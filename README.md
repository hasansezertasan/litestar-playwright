Playwright integration for Litestar.

---

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [License](#license)


## Features

- ðŸŽ­ **Browser Management**: Manage Playwright browser instances
- ðŸ”§ **Dependency Injection**: Automatic injection of browser instances into route handlers
- âš¡ **Async Support**: Full async/await support for all operations

## Installation

```sh
uv add litestar-playwright
```

## Quick Start

```python
from litestar import Litestar
from litestar_playwright.config import PlaywrightConfig
from litestar_playwright.plugin import PlaywrightPlugin

# Create the plugin with configuration
playwright_plugin = PlaywrightPlugin(
    config=PlaywrightConfig(
        headless=False,  # Show browser windows
        browser_type="chromium"  # or "firefox", "webkit"
    )
)

# Add to your Litestar app
app = Litestar(plugins=[playwright_plugin])
```

## Configuration

The `PlaywrightConfig` class provides several configuration options:

```python
@dataclass
class PlaywrightConfig:
    headless: bool = True
    """Whether to run browsers in headless mode."""

    browser_type: str = "chromium"
    """Type of browser to use (chromium, firefox, webkit)."""

    playwright_app_state_key: str = "playwright_browser"
    """Key used to store the browser instance in app state."""
```

## Usage

### Accessing Browser Instances

The plugin automatically injects browser instances into your route handlers:

```python
from litestar import get
from playwright.async_api import Browser

@get("/my-route")
async def my_route(playwright_browser: Browser) -> str:
    # Create a new context
    context = await playwright_browser.new_context()

    # Create a new page
    page = await context.new_page()

    # Navigate to a URL
    await page.goto("https://example.com")

    return "Page loaded!"
```

### Web Scraping Example

Here's a complete example of web scraping with the plugin:

```python
from litestar import get
from playwright.async_api import Browser

@get("/scrape")
async def scrape_website(playwright_browser: Browser) -> dict:
    # Create a new context
    context = await playwright_browser.new_context()

    try:
        # Create a new page
        page = await context.new_page()

        # Navigate to a website
        await page.goto("https://example.com")

        # Extract information
        title = await page.title()
        content = await page.content()

        return {
            "title": title,
            "content_length": len(content)
        }
    finally:
        # Always clean up
        await context.close()
```

### Multiple Playwright Plugins Example

You can use multiple Playwright plugins in a single application for different use cases:

```python
from litestar import Litestar, get
from playwright.async_api import Browser
from litestar_playwright.config import PlaywrightConfig
from litestar_playwright.plugin import PlaywrightPlugin

# Create different configurations for various browsers
chrome_config = PlaywrightConfig(
    headless=False,
    browser_type="chromium",
    playwright_browser_instance_state_key="chrome_browser",
    launch_kwargs={"args": ["--no-sandbox"]},
)

firefox_config = PlaywrightConfig(
    headless=False,
    browser_type="firefox",
    playwright_browser_instance_state_key="firefox_browser",
)

# Route handlers can inject specific browser instances
@get("/chrome-info")
async def chrome_info(chrome_browser: Browser) -> dict:
    return {"browser": chrome_browser.browser_type.name}

@get("/firefox-info")
async def firefox_info(firefox_browser: Browser) -> dict:
    return {"browser": firefox_browser.browser_type.name}

# Use multiple plugins in your app
app = Litestar(
    plugins=[
        PlaywrightPlugin(config=chrome_config),
        PlaywrightPlugin(config=firefox_config),
    ],
    route_handlers=[chrome_info, firefox_info],
)
```

This approach is useful for:
- **Cross-browser testing**: Test your application across different browsers
- **Specialized workflows**: Use different browsers for different tasks
- **CI/CD scenarios**: Run headless browsers for automated testing
- **Performance testing**: Compare behavior across browser engines
