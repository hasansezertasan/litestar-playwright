## About

`litestar-playwright` is a plugin for [Litestar](https://litestar.dev/) that provides Playwright integration.

:sparkles: This project was born out of necessity when I was working on a project that required me to take screenshots :camera_flash:of given HTML content. I was using Playwright for this purpose, but I was not satisfied with my workflow. While improving the workflow, I started a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/litestar-org/discussions/4249) :speech_balloon: at the Litestar Organization. Even though the discussion had zero activity :zzz:, it was a great opportunity to discover some of the internal mechanisms of Litestar. After over-engineering the workflow :nerd_face:, I decided to create a plugin for Litestar that would provide seamless Playwright integration. I learned a lot about how to use Playwright with Litestar on the way :rocket:.
